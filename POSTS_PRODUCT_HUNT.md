## LAUNCH INFO

**Name:** Hope Genome

**Tagline:** Cryptographic proof that AI can't lie

**Description:**
```
Hope Genome is an open-source framework that makes AI lies detectable and provable through cryptography.

Built in 4 days by a factory worker (me) and Claude (Anthropic's AI), it uses Ed25519 signatures and BFT consensus to create tamper-evident records of every AI decision.

300 adversarial attacks tested. Zero breaches.

If your AI lies, you have proof. If it doesn't, you have proof of that too.

Free. Open source. MIT license.
```

**First Comment:**
```
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Máté - a factory worker from Hungary who doesn't know how to code.

4 days ago, I asked Claude: "What if AI couldn't lie?"

Today, we're launching Hope Genome.

This isn't just another AI tool. It's a framework that creates cryptographic evidence of AI behavior. Every decision signed. Every violation tracked.

I didn't write the code - Claude did. But I brought the vision. That's how human-AI collaboration should work.

Why does this matter?
- AI is making more decisions every day
- We need proof of what it decides
- "Trust me" isn't good enough anymore

Try it:
pip install hope-genome

Break it if you can. Or help us make it better.

Happy to answer any questions!
```
