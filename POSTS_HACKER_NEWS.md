## ELSŐ COMMENT (posztolás után írd ezt)

```
Hi HN,

I'm Máté, a factory worker from Hungary. Not a programmer.

4 days ago I started collaborating with Claude (Anthropic's AI) on an idea: cryptographic accountability for AI systems.

The result is Hope Genome:
- Ed25519 signatures on every AI decision
- BFT consensus for multi-agent scenarios
- Watchdog with hard reset after 10 violations
- Tested against 300 adversarial attacks (0 breaches)

The Rust core is ~800 lines. Python bindings via PyO3.

Some will say "AI wrote this, doesn't count." I disagree. Claude wrote the code. I brought the vision and the "why." That's partnership, not cheating.

The question I'm asking: is this the future? Humans providing direction, AI providing implementation?

Would love technical feedback. The BFT implementation especially could use expert eyes.

pip install hope-genome
cargo add hope_core
```

## VÁLASZOK ELŐKÉSZÍTVE

**Ha kérdezik: "Did AI write this?"**
```
Yes. Claude wrote most of the code. I'm not a programmer - I'm a factory worker.

But I provided the vision, the philosophy, the use cases. Claude provided the implementation.

Is that cheating? I don't think so. It's collaboration.

The code is open source. Judge it by what it does, not who typed it.
```

**Ha kérdezik: "Why should I trust this?"**
```
You shouldn't trust it. You should VERIFY it.

That's the whole point. The code is open source. The cryptographic proofs are auditable. Run the tests yourself.

Trust is for humans. Verification is for code.
```

**Ha kérdezik: "What's the use case?"**
```
Any scenario where you need to prove what an AI decided:
- Healthcare AI recommendations
- Financial AI decisions
- Legal AI analysis
- Autonomous systems

If someone asks "why did the AI do that?" - you have cryptographic proof.
```

**Ha kritizálják:**
```
Fair points. We're open to feedback.

This is v1. Built in 4 days. Not perfect.

But it's a start. And it's open source.

What would you do differently?
