## ÁLTALÁNOS SABLON

**Subject:** Factory worker + AI built cryptographic AI ethics framework - open source

**Body:**
```
Hi,

I'm Máté, a factory worker from Hungary. Not a programmer.

4 days ago I started collaborating with Claude (Anthropic's AI) on an idea that became Hope Genome - an open-source framework that creates cryptographic proof of AI behavior.

Why it matters:
- AI makes decisions that affect lives
- We need verifiable proof of what AI decides
- "Trust us" isn't good enough

What we built:
- Ed25519 signatures on every AI decision
- BFT consensus for multi-agent systems
- Tested against 300 adversarial attacks (0 breaches)
- Available on PyPI and Crates.io

The interesting angle: I can't code. Claude wrote everything. But I provided the vision. Is this the future of human-AI collaboration?

Would you be interested in covering this?

Demo video: [ha lesz]

Best,

## TECH ÚJSÁGÍRÓKNAK

**Subject:** Exclusive: Non-programmer builds AI ethics framework with Claude

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

I have an unusual story for you.

I'm a factory worker from Hungary. No programming background. But I just released an open-source AI ethics framework that passed 300 adversarial attack tests.

How? I collaborated with Claude (Anthropic's AI).

4 days. Intense work. Real code. Real results.

The framework - Hope Genome - uses cryptographic signatures to create tamper-evident records of AI decisions. If an AI lies, you have proof.

Why this matters now:
- AI regulation is coming
- Companies need accountability frameworks
- "We tested it internally" won't be enough

I'd be happy to do an interview about:
- What it's like to "code" without knowing how to code
- Whether human-AI collaboration is the future
- The technical details (Claude can explain those)

GitHub: github.com/silentnoisehun/Hope_Genome

Interested?

Máté Róbert

## AI ETHICS KUTATÓKNAK

**Subject:** Open source cryptographic AI accountability framework - feedback requested

**Body:**
```
Dear [Name],

I've followed your work on AI ethics/accountability with interest.

I recently released Hope Genome, an open-source framework that uses cryptographic proofs (Ed25519 + BFT consensus) to create verifiable records of AI behavior.

I'm not an academic - I'm a factory worker who collaborated with Claude (Anthropic) to build this. But I believe the technical approach might interest you:

1. Every AI decision is signed with Ed25519
2. BFT consensus prevents single-agent manipulation
3. Violation tracking with hard reset threshold
4. All evidence is auditable

We tested against 300 adversarial attack vectors with no breaches.

I would greatly appreciate your feedback, criticism, or suggestions for improvement.

Repository: github.com/silentnoisehun/Hope_Genome
Technical docs: [link to docs]

Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,
Máté Róbert

## YOUTUBERS / PODCASTERS

**Subject:** Wild story: Factory worker builds AI framework with Claude

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Got a story that might interest your audience.

I'm a factory worker from Hungary. Can't code. But I just released an open-source AI ethics framework on GitHub, PyPI, and Crates.io.

How? I partnered with Claude (Anthropic's AI).

4 days of intense collaboration. Claude wrote the code. I brought the vision and philosophy.

The result: Hope Genome - cryptographic proof that AI can't lie.

Why it's interesting:
- Non-programmer builds real software with AI
- Human-AI collaboration as equals, not master-servant
- Raises questions about the future of work
- Actually works (300 attacks tested, 0 breaches)

I'd love to come on your show and talk about:
- The collaboration process
- What it means for the future
- Live demo of breaking/testing the system

Interested?
