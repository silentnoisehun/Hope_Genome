    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: Marvin Attack on RSA
    #
    # This is a timing sidechannel vulnerability in the RSA crate. As of January 2025,
    # there is no fixed version available. The maintainers are actively working on
    # mitigation in https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/390
    #
    # Risk Assessment: ACCEPTED
    # - Hope Genome is designed for local execution, not network-facing environments
    # - The attack requires the attacker to observe precise timing information
    # - This would require local access to the machine running Hope Genome
    # - If an attacker has local access, they have already compromised the system
    #
    # Mitigation: Users are advised not to deploy Hope Genome in environments where
    # timing attacks are feasible (e.g., shared hosting, cloud environments with
    # co-located VMs). For production use, deploy on dedicated hardware.
    #
    # Tracking: Will upgrade to rsa 0.10+ when stable version is released
